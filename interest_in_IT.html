I have always had a strong interest in PCs from a young age. I remember when I first saw my cousin's PC when I was about<br>
six years old and how amazed I was at how you could print an image on the screen to paper!<br>
I am very passionate about computer hardware, I build PCs as a hobby and I enjoy overclocking my PC in my spare time to see
how far I can push the parts.<br><br>
In terms of experience though, is where I fall short. I have been working as a car mechanic for almost 10 years, so IT is merely
a hobby.<br>
This all changed when I saw the free TAFE courses from the government and I thought to myself, maybe it's time for a change!<br>
I enrolled in a Certificate IV in Cyber Security to take the first steps into, I hope, a new and challenging career.<br>During
my time studying the Cert IV, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about computer networking, security principles and programming<br>
with Python.<br><br>
    
I chose RMIT to do my studies because I am working full-time and raising a young family.<br>
I work 38 hours per week at minimum and also attend two-night classes for my Certificate IV so attending university via <br>
face to face method was not an option.<br>
In my current circumstances, RMIT, in-collaboration with Open Universities Australia (OUA) catered to my needs of an online study<br>
option.<br>
I don't have any previous tertiary study so getting a direct entry into a Bachelor degree is almost an impossible task, let alone <br>
finding one that was also available to study online.<br>
After speaking to OUA and RMIT, they suggested for me to do the 'Introduction to IT' and 'Introduction to Programming' subjects <br>
as a stepping stone towards completing a Bachelor degree while getting a taste of what university will be like.<br><br>

I expect to come out of the two subjects with much more in-depth knowledge of the IT field.<br>
I will improve on thinking outside the box and apply my knowledge of IT to help improve the quality of life of people and other <br>
industries. <br>
I would like to improve my critical thinking as well as my creative imagination and I believe this course will help me achieve that.<br>
I hope to learn more about cybersecurity and the ways we can improve the protection of confidential and sensitive data, catching <br>
threats before they do damage and progress into a career in cyberspace.<br><br>
