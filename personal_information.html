Hello everyone and welcome to my profile page!<br><br>
My name is Daniel Lay and I am studying two Bachelor of IT subjects at RMIT University.<br> <br>
So, a bit about myself; I am 27 years old, married and a father of two.<br> 
I am of East Timorese descent but I was born in Australia, so I am technically a true blue, meat pie eating Aussie!<br>
My parents migrated to Australia in the 80's after the civil war broke out in Timor.<br>
We speak Hakka at home, which an old Chinese dialect and my mother taught me Mandarin from a young age.<br><br>
The highest education I have achieved to date is my Certificate III in Automotive Mechanical, and I work as a car mechanic.<br>
I am a self-proclaimed geek, I love computer hardware and watching anime.<br>
Something that most people don't know about me is that I am a massive footy head!<br>I can sit through any AFL match regardless
of the teams playing and have a good old time analysing the game.<br><br>
