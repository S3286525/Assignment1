My ideal job is to become a cybersecurity architect. <br> 
The role of the architect is to utilise their abundance of knowledge and experience to create and implement security solutions for organisations.<br> 
In addition to designing the architecture, they will also be responsible for maintaining defence, responding to incidents and provide guidance with<br>
risk assessments and security policies. (Cyber Security Education & Cyber Degrees, 2019)<br><br>
This job appeals to me because I have aspirations to become a cybersecurity specialist, but why stop there? The sky is the limit and I want to push<br>
myself to that limit and achieve something that I once thought was impossible. Becoming a leader and providing guidance to a team of specialists would be a<br>
massive achievement in my career.<br><br>
To become a cybersecurity architect, there is a long and arduous task ahead. First and foremost, is attaining a tertiary degree such as a <br>
Bachelor or Master’s degree in an IT or related field such as cybersecurity or computer science. (Cyber Security Education & Cyber Degrees, 2019)<br>
It is also expected for potential candidates to have done other security certifications such as CISSP, CISM, SABSA, CRISC, SANS, CCNP, etc. (Cyber Degrees, 2019)<br>
Aside from degrees and certifications, security architect applicants are also expected to have a good amount of experience working in the field.<br><br>
My current skills, qualifications and experience are very little.<br>
I come from a non-IT based background being a car mechanic, so I have achieved a Certificate III level qualification thus far.<br>
I am currently studying a Certificate IV in Cyber Security as my first step towards a career in the cybersecurity field.<br>
My plan to achieve a career as a cybersecurity architect would start with finishing off my Cert IV, continue with the Bachelor of Information Technology and move into a Bachelor of Cyber Security.<br>
I would like to change jobs during my studies to gain precious experience in the IT field, hopefully as a security analyst or penetration tester.<br>
Once I have finished my Bachelor studies, I would like to continue to attaining a Master’s degree and continue to develop my skill set and knowledge while working in a relevant job.<br>
My hope is once I have completed my studies, and attained certifications such as CCNP, CISSP and SANS,<br>
I would have advanced in my career to the point where I can show employers the wealth of experience I possess and the drive I have to become an architect.<br><br>
