<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
The project idea is an “AI Health System” for motor vehicles.<br>
It is a system built into the car to monitor the driver’s condition.<br>
An AI software will be monitoring key vital areas such as heart rate and breathing;<br>
as well as eye, head and body movement via sensor feedback.<br> 
The AI will also be able to engage with the driver if it detects an anomaly or the driver requests help.<br>
In the incidence where the driver is unable to control the vehicle due to a medical emergency or falling asleep,<br>
the AI will take over the driving of the vehicle using autonomous mode.<br> 
It will then manoeuvre the vehicle to a safe spot, and contact local emergency services.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Why should we need it?</h2>
<p>
Every year, there are many fatalities on Australian roads.<br> 
As of July 2019, road-related deaths have already reached 729, which is 75 more deaths than the same time last year.<br>
While there have been drastic improvements in reducing road toll over the years, the work is far from finished. (Bitre.gov.au, 2019)<br>
A research paper by Lindsay and Baldock (2008, p. 613) found that out of the 298 vehicle accident cases they studied,<br>
276 of those cases involved participants with a pre-existing medical condition.<br>
This project idea could potentially save a lot of lives, not only the drivers but anyone else who may be involved.<br>
This will bring the road toll figures even lower, perhaps even achieving zero?<br><br>
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
The AI Health System will incorporate existing technologies in modern vehicles as well as build upon ideas and concepts that have appeared in the past.<br>
The system will incorporate into the vehicles gateway; the data exchange point that interconnects all of the vehicles ECUs.<br>
The gateway allows the translation of protocols and transfer of data between the ECUs (STMicroelectronics, 2019).<br>
Monitoring sensors are used to provide the driver’s vital data to the AI-based ECU.<br>
There would be electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors built into the seat backrest, steering wheel and seat belt to monitor the driver’s heart rate and breathing patterns (Pai, 2014a, 2014b);<br> 
as well as sensors placed around the vehicle that can track your eye, head and body movements (Tran & Trivedi, 2009).<br><br>
 
The AI will be trained using machine/deep learning to understand human anatomy and its behaviour patterns, in both natural and driving conditions.<br>
Utilising the feedback from the sensors along with its built-in knowledge,
the AI can continue learning about the driver’s characteristics including posture and heart rate to build a rapport that personalises the solution for them.<br>
If the vehicle has more than one driver, the software will be able to store separate driver profiles.<br>
It will have the capability to detect when the driver if suffering from a medical episode such as a heart attack, seizure or blacking out.<br>
The software will also be able to interact with the driver and inform them with any irregularities in the data collected which can alert the driver to either stop driving or ask them how they are feeling.<br>
The driver will be able to make requests for health monitoring information and guidance to a doctor or hospital if they are not feeling well via the vehicles microphone.<br><br>
	
In the event where a medical emergency has occurred, which will be determined by the data such as head and body slouch, eyes closed or hands off the steering wheel.<br>
In addition to lack of interaction from the driver, the AI will activate the autonomous vehicle control mode.<br><br>

As the AI Health System is incorporated into the gateway, it has access to the sensors and systems in modern vehicles<br>
such as radar sensors, parking sensors, cameras, blind-spot monitoring along with electronic power steering, brakes and throttle.<br>
Using these resources, the autonomous mode will be able to control the vehicle without any driver input as well as detecting other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights and obstructions.<br><br> 
 	
The system will then auto-pilot the vehicle to a safe location to stop and utilise a 5G receiver to contact emergency services.<br>
A 5G receiver will be used as it allows very fast data transfer, with connection speeds up to 1.4Gbps (McCann & Moore, 2019).<br> 
Information such as the driver’s condition, log of the recorded data and vehicle location coordinates will be included in the SOS call.<br>
This extra information will allow emergency services to respond quickly and accurately.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Hardware and Software requirements</h2>
<p>
There will be more hardware than software requirements for the AI Health System to function.<br>
The ECU would be the main piece of hardware required, which will run a Neuromorphic Processing Unit (NPU)as they specialise in handling AI workloads and machine/deep learning.<br>
AI processors are much more efficient than normal CPUs in AI tasks (Khillar, 2019).<br> 
Other hardware required are electrocardiogram sensors, vehicle sensors and cameras to supply the ECU with data to be analysed.<br>
Geolocation tracking will be sourced from the GPS receiver.<br>
As for the software side, AI software could be developed by the open-source program, TensorFlow.<br>
Alternatively, the company Nvidia do offer autonomous driving vehicle software and hardware solutions as well as GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) powered AI machine/deep learning software.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Skills and Traits</h2>
<p>
The skills that would be required for the project would involve having very in-depth knowledge of AI and machine/deep learning.<br>
Being adept to program in a coding language such as Python, Java and Lisp is a prerequisite (Nautiyal 2019; Varshneya 2018).<br> 
Having strong knowledge of mathematics and algorithms, expertise on Unix tools as well as having a creative mind to think outside the box<br>
are all important skills and traits to step into the world of AI and machine learning (Varshneya, 2018).<br>
The result of a successful AI health monitoring system incorporated into vehicles would be a big step forward in reducing road fatalities.<br>
Being able to monitor the driver’s health condition and having an AI that is ready to respond instantly in the event of an emergency,<br>
not only provides the driver assistance but can potentially save the lives of innocent bystanders.<br>
The adoption of health monitoring in vehicles would be a game-changer in road safety and could raise awareness for keeping oneself in good health.
